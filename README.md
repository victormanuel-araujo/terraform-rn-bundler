# Terraform 

This repository was created with the intention of carrying out a college work. The main idea was that with terraform codes it would be possible to make a website available through nginx.

The second idea is to have a virtual machine with node and yarn installed, at this moment I'm facing an issue with testing a feature without the needed resources to be able to do so, as I was finishing this exercise I thought that if we had a remote React Native bundler I could send a development app to the tester and be able to debug, I know this is not the best approach to do so, but trying it out and seing working was actually pretty nice.

Although I told about creating an environment to run the react native metro, I'm doing this connecting with SSH so no needed password will be hardcoded.
